Each card is procedurally generated to give even more variety to the gameplay.

Evolving a card can have different effects: Increase damage output, decrease AP cost, adding Area Of Effect damage, or even adding a new status effect.

Magic cards can be very powerful but have a casting time that vary between cards.

## Level Progression

Completing any level will reward you with a card plus a specific reward based on your level reward choice.

After a fight, doors to the next level will appear. Pick the one based on your game strategy!

If you are low on health you might want to aim for a Health recovery reward, but you can also try to gain more souls, find shops, or if you are confident in your skills you can even try rooms with additional challenge but double rewards.

Every X amount of levels, you will encounter a Boss room, where you will find one or multiple incredibly strong enemies.
